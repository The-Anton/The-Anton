 # ðŸ‘‹Hey,

My name is Shekhar, and I am a computer science undergrad from Pune, India.
 
In high school, I learned to build various cool things as a kid, such as Arduino robots, websites, and even Android apps, which shaped my passion for computer science. I'm a pre-final year student pursuing a B.E in Information Technology. I took up many part-time projects developing web apps as a hobby. I am a community leader for [Google Developer Students Clubs](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc), where I collaborate with others to create solutions for the local community and spread open-source and cutting-edge technology knowledge.
 
These days, I work as a [GitHub Extern](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/index.html), contributing to open-source projects and developing scalable end products for the organization. I manage the [IncubateIND Fellows Project](https://github.com/incubateind/fellows), which is a web-based solution for community management and event hosting platforms. I'm primarily responsible for creating the backend infrastructure and managing the codebase.
